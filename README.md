# algos backend

Something that sometime may be a backend for a cool visualisation tool.

For now, I'm using it as a way for me to learn Scala by implementing various graph algorithms. Once, I get a bit more familiar with Scala, I'm looking for getting more hands-on on functional programming.

After that, I may code the backend.
